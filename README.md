# Sticky-Buster
Userscript (may evolve into a WebExtension) to persistently remove sticky bars on websites

If you have a userscript manager installed (Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, etc.), [here’s the script](https://github.com/Watilin/Sticky-Buster/raw/u1.0/sticky-buster.user.js). It should install automatically.

## Compatibility

Here’s what I tested so far:

* Google Chrome with Tampermonkey: fully functional :white_check_mark:
* Palemoon with Greasemonkey: fully functional :white_check_mark:
* Firefox < 57 (pre-Quantum): untested but should be equivalent to Palemoon
* Firefox Quantum: sadly not working :x:

Compatibility with Quantum is a big incentive to switch to WebExtensions. This is probably my last userscript of all times.
